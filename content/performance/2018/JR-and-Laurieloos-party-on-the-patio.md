We had so much fun at this year's Party on the Patio that we decided to make it an annual event. A $10 donation would be appreciated to help cover the cost of the band. Bring your lawn chairs, coolers and a snack to share for the potluck. Spread the word and let's make this Party on the Patio even better than 2017!
