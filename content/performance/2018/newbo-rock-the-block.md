Join the Compass Rose Band as we return to the Newbo City Market to Rock the Block! Opening for the CRB at 5:30pm will be the Country Band. Bring your lawn chairs (no coolers please) for a free concert on the grounds of the Newbo City Market. Plenty of food and drink vendors will be available on-site.
