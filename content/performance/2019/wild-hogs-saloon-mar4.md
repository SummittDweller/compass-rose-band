We've had a lot of fun and made a lot of friends playing at Wild Hogs Saloon in Walford, IA, so we're excited to announce that we will be performing there once a month! We will play on the 1st Monday of every month, starting on March 4th. We will still perform there occasionally on the weekends, too. If you want to keep the weekend going or just want to cut loose after that dreadful Monday back-to-work, come out and party with us at Wild Hogs Saloon from 5:00 - 9:00 pm on the 1st Monday of every month!
