We will play on the 1st Monday of every month, starting on March 4th. We will still perform there occasionally on the weekends, too. If you want to keep the weekend going or just want to cut loose after that dreadful Monday back-to-work, come out and party with us at Wild Hogs Saloon from 5:00 - 9:00 pm on the 1st Monday of every month!</description></item><item><title>Wild Hogs Saloon</title><link>https://thecompassroseband.com/performance/2019/wild-hogs-saloon-feb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thecompassroseband.com/performance/2019/wild-hogs-saloon-feb/</guid><description>Join us for a special Sunday performance at one of our very favorite places to play!
